Universal Web Interface Designer for ESP8266 and ESP32:
- allows you to quickly create a webmord for controlling and setting up an electronic device
- works on the basis of standard ESP libraries, nothing needs to be installed additionally
- the creation of multi-page and dynamic web interfaces in several lines of code directly in the sketch
- does not require knowledge HTML, CSS and JavaScript: all styles and scripts are already laid down in the library
- Written on pure HTML + CSS + JS, no third-party web library
- does not require connection to the Internet
- does not require downloading files in spiffs (but styles and scripts can be downloaded from there to save memory)
- relatively stylish design, light and dark themes + ‚Äúcontrol panel‚Äù template with a drop -down menu, customization of components (size, color)
- Built -in modules:
  - Interaction with the browser: receiving and sending values on components, indication "offline", change in the name of the page
  - several dozen standard components, instruments of miles and navigation (buttons, icons, graphs, sliders, tables, tabs ...)
  - Automated download of files from Spiffs + Caching
  - Automated file download in spiffs
  - System Information output block and file manager (SD, Littlefs, Spifs ...)
  - HTML Canvas API with the ability to draw from a sketch + drawing API as in Processing
  - Real time hours (based on browser time)
  - Automatic survey and updating of variables from the list
  - Authorization on the server by login-Parol
  - DNS server (for work as an access point)
  - MDNS (to open the interface at a given address instead of IP)
  - OTA updating the firmware and memory through a browser or CURL (it is possibleCranberries ashita password)

## Installation
- The library can be found by the name ** GyverPortal ** and installed through the library manager in:
    - Arduino ide
    - Arduino ide v2
    - Platformio
- [download the library] (https://github.com/gyverlibs/gyverPortal/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) .Zip archive for manual installation:
    - unpack and put in * C: \ Program Files (X86) \ Arduino \ Libraries * (Windows X64)
    - unpack and put in * C: \ Program Files \ Arduino \ Libraries * (Windows X32)
    - unpack and put in *documents/arduino/libraries/ *
    - (Arduino id) Automatic installation from. Zip: * sketch/connect the library/add .Zip library ... * and specify downloaded archive
- Read more detailed instructions for installing libraries [here] (https://alexgyver.ru/arduino-first/#%D0%A3%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%BD%D0%BE%BE%BE%BED0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA)

### Update
- I recommend always updating the library: errors and bugs are corrected in the new versions, as well as optimization and new features are added
- through the IDE library manager: find the library how to install and click "update"
- Manually: ** remove the folder with the old version **, and then put a new one in its place.‚ÄúReplacement‚Äù cannot be done: sometimes in new versions, files that remain when replacing are deleted and can lead to errors!
- ** When using files and scripts in spiffs, they also need to be replaced with new **
- After the update, you need to clean the browser cache, just press Ctrl+F5 for the Chrome on the loaded page of the portal

## bugs and feedback
Create ** Issue ** when you find the bugs, and better immediately write to the mail [alex@alexgyver.ru] (mailto: alex@alexgyver.ru)
The library is open for refinement and your ** pull Request ** 'ow!

When reporting about bugs or incorrect work of the library, it is necessary to indicate:
- The version of the library
- What is MK used
- SDK version (for ESP)
- version of Arduino ide
- whether the built -in examples work correctly, in which the functions and designs are used, leading to a bug in your code
- what code has been loaded, what work was expected from it and how it works in reality
- Ideally, attach the minimum code in which the bug is observed.Not a canvas of a thousand lines, but a minimum code
